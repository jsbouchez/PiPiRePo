# GitLab -- Labels

Labels in GitLab projects are a way to categorize and filter issues, merge requests, and epics. They essentially act as tags that help you organize your work.

Here's what labels are intended for:

__Improved Organization:__ With labels, you can group similar items together. This makes it easier to find specific issues or merge requests later, especially in larger projects.
__Quick Filtering:__ You can filter the issue or merge request list based on assigned labels. This allows you to focus on tasks with a particular priority, bug reports, feature requests, and so on.
__Workflow Management:__ Labels can be used to represent different stages in your workflow. For example, you can have labels for "In Progress," "In Review," and "Blocked."
Here's how to use labels within GitLab projects:

__Creating Labels:__ You can create project-specific labels or group labels that apply across multiple projects within a group.
To create a label, go to your project's settings, navigate to "Manage" and then "Labels." There, you can define a name, description (optional), and color for your label.
__Assigning Labels:__ Labels can be assigned to issues and merge requests. You can assign labels while creating a new issue/request or by editing existing ones.
By effectively using labels, you can significantly improve the organization and clarity of your GitLab projects.
